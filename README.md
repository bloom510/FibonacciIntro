# FibonacciIntro
<p>
This repository contains the code that serves as the basis for a series of my
JavaScript+HTML5 Canvas pieces, <em>Fun With Fibonacci</em> (more gifs will be added to this readme soon).
</p>
<p>
/HardCoded contains the initial code playground in which parameters are hard coded.
</p>
<p>
/Process reworks the code into a more modular, object oriented format demonstrating the creative process for the series of pieces.
